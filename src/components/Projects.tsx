Based on the extremely positive feedback received from both patients and doctors, the application is being further developed at the moment. The main areas of improvement are the graphics for the human body (have a 3D representation), and the precision of the symptom checker, which is going to be significantly improved by collaborating with specialists and using Artificial Intelligence (Neural Networks).",
